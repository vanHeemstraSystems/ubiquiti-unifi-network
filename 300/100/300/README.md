# 300 - Step 3 – Adopt Devices

With UniFi Network fully updated, we can start with adopting our network devices:

1. Open the **UniFi Network App**.
2. Click on **Devices**.
3. Click on **Click to Adopt** for each device.


It can happen that a device won’t adopt. This happens when for example the firmware is too old on the device or when it’s previously managed by another UniFi Controller. Check out [this article](https://lazyadmin.nl/home-network/unifi-adoption-failed/) for more information on how to solve adoption issues.
