# 100 - Step 1 – Initial Setup Process

The initial setup of our UniFi Cloud Gateway or Console is best done using a Bluetooth connection and the UniFi Network app. You can download the app here for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ubnt.easyunifi&hl=en&gl=US) and here for [Apple](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/unifi/id1057750338). Make sure that you have the app installed on your phone.

Connect the WAN port of your Cloud Gateway or console to the internet and connect the power to start the device. The device needs a couple of minutes to power up, in the meantime open the app on your mobile.

**Note**: If you don’t want to use the app, then connect a laptop to the network, open a browser and go to http://192.168.1.1 to complete the initial setup.
