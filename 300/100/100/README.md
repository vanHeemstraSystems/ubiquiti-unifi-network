# 100 - Step 1 – Initial Setup Process

The initial setup of our UniFi Cloud Gateway or Console is best done using a Bluetooth connection and the UniFi Network app. You can download the app here for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ubnt.easyunifi&hl=en&gl=US) and here for [Apple](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/unifi/id1057750338). Make sure that you have the app installed on your phone.

Connect the WAN port of your Cloud Gateway or console to the internet and connect the power to start the device. The device needs a couple of minutes to power up, in the meantime open the app on your mobile.

**Note**: If you don’t want to use the app, then connect a laptop to the network, open a browser and go to http://192.168.1.1 to complete the initial setup.

While the console is still *initializing*, click on **Sign In** to sign in to your UI Account or to create a new Ubiquiti account. This account allows you to manage your network easily from the internet and also allows you to store automatic backups of your configuration in the cloud.

After you have logged in, you might need to click on the **Plus icon** to find the new console. Once it’s done with *initializing*, click on **Tap to Setup**.

In the initial setup process of our UniFi console, we can give the console a name (or leave it default). Depending on the console type you can configure a wireless network. We can change the network later on, but it allows you to quickly connect to your network once the setup is completed.

Click on **Connect** when you are done and wait for the setup process to complete.
