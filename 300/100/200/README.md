# 200 - Step 2 – Update UniFi Apps and UniFi OS Settings

If you have created or used a Ubiquiti account in the previous step, then you can now log in on [unifi.ui.com](https://unifi.ui.com/) to access your console. This will open the Site Manager where you will see your console

Now the first step is to make sure that it’s **fully up-to-date**. At the moment of writing, UniFi Network 8.0 is released, but the console is still running on 7.x. Click on the **console icon** to open the console settings (UniFi OS)

It may take a minute or two before the console has checked if there are updates available, but make sure that all the applications are updated to the latest version:

While we are in the UniFi OS Settings, open the **Console Settings** (2). Make sure that the System Config Backup is Enabled and check if the location/time zone is correct. Here you can also enable or disable the LED / LCM Screen of the console.

Especially with the UniFi Dream Router or UniFi Express, that you often place insight, you might want to turn the screen off at night or lower the brightness.
